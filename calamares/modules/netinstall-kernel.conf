### Netinstall module
#
# The netinstall module allows distribution maintainers to ship minimal ISOs
# with only a basic set of preinstalled packages. At installation time, the
# user is presented with the choice to install groups of packages from a
# predefined list.
#
# Calamares will then use the *packages* module to install the packages.
# Without a *packages* module in the exec phase somewhere **after**
# this netinstall, nothing will actually get installed. The packages
# module must be correctly configured **and** the package manager must
# be runnable from within the installed system at the point where it
# is invoked, otherwise you'll get nothing.
#
# There are two basic deployment schemes:
#  - static package lists; the packages do not change for this release.
#    In this case, the package list file may be on the ISO-image itself
#    as a separate file, **or** included in this configuration file.
#    Either will do; separate file is easier to update independently
#    of the Calamares configuration, while merged configurations use
#    fewer files overall and are closer to self-documenting.
#  - online package lists; the package list is fetched from a remote
#    URL and handled otherwise like a static list. This can be useful
#    if the package list needs updating during the lifetime of an ISO-
#    image, e.g. packages are added or renamed.
#
# There is only one required key for this module, *groupsUrl*.
#
# This module supports multiple instances through the *label* key,
# which allows you to distinguish them in the UI.
---
# The *groupsUrl* determines where the data for the netinstall groups-and-
# packages comes from. The value of the key may be:
#
# - a single string (this is treated as a list with just that string in it)
# - a list of strings
#
# Each string is treated as a URL (see below for special cases. The
# list is examined **in order** and each URL is tried in turn. The
# first URL to load successfully -- even if it yields 0 packages --
# ends the process. This allows using a network URL and a (fallback)
# local URL for package lists, or for using multiple mirrors of
# netinstall data.
#
# The URL must point to a YAML file that follows the format described
# below at the key *groups* -- except for the special case URL "local".
# Note that the contents of the groups file is the **important**
# part of the configuration of this module. It specifies what
# groups and packages the user may select (and so what commands are to
# be run to install them).
#
# The format of the groups file is the same as the format of the
# *groups* key described below, **except** that a stand-alone
# groups file does not have to have the top-level *groups* key.
# (It **may** have one, though, for instance when you copy
# this configuration file to `netinstall.yaml` and key *groups*
# must have a list-of-groups as value; if the file does not have
# a top-level key *groups*, then the file must contain only a list of groups.
#
# Each item in the list *groupsUrl* may be:
# - A remote URL like `http://example.org/netinstall.php`
# - A local file URL like `file:///usr/share/calamares/netinstall.yaml`
# - The special-case literal string `local`
#
# Non-special case URLs are loaded as YAML; if the load succeeds, then
# they are interpreted like the *groups* key below. The special case
# `local` loads the data directly from **this** file.
#
#groupsUrl: local

# Alternate form:
# groupsUrl: [ local ]

# Net-based package list, with fallback to local file

# If the installation can proceed without netinstall (e.g. the Live CD
# can create a working installed system, but netinstall is preferred
# to bring it up-to-date or extend functionality) leave this set to
# false (the default). If set to true, the netinstall data is required.
#
# This only has an effect if the netinstall data cannot be retrieved,
# or is corrupt: having "required" set, means the install cannot proceed.
required: false

# To support multiple instances of this module,
# some strings are configurable and translatable here.
# - *sidebar* This is the name of the module in the progress-tree / sidebar
#   in Calamares.
# - *title* This is displayed above the list of packages.
# If no *sidebar* values are provided, defaults to "Package selection"
# and existing translations. If no *title* values are provided, no string
# is displayed.
#
# The following strings are already known to Calamares and can be
# listed here in *untranslated* form (e.g. as value of *sidebar*)
# without bothering with the translations: they are picked up from
# the regular translation framework:
#   - "Package selection"
#   - "Office software"
#   - "Office package"
#   - "Browser software"
#   - "Browser package"
#   - "Web browser"
label:
    sidebar: "Kernel"
    sidebar[nl]: "Kernel"
    title: "Kernel"
    title[nl]: "Kernel"
